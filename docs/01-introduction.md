## Introduction

Today's build tooling is built on an old assumption: that web applications can't run in the browser without a bundler. This had been true in the past, but ESM `import`/`export` support in the browser changed everything. 

**The truth is, you no longer need a bundler during development.**

This is great news for developers because most bundlers introduce a complex mix of configuration, plugins, dependencies and complexity that you probably wouldn't otherwise need. Not only that, but bundling during development introduces a significant slow down to your dev workflow, as you wait for entire chunks of your application to rebuild just because you changed a single file. Bundling is still a great production optimization, but it really has little use during development.

**Snowpack marks the start of an entirely new generation of bundle-free development tooling.**

### What is Snowpack?

<div class="notification is-link">
  <strong>Snowpack is bundle-free build tooling for React, Vue, Svelte and more.</strong> Snowpack's lightning-fast dev server starts up in &lt;20ms and reflects changes instantly thanks to single-file rebuilding. When you're ready to deploy, Snowpack will build, bundle, and optimize your site for production.
</div>

Snowpack removes the bundler from your development workflow so that you can build faster with less complexity. Connect your favorite build tools like Babel and PostCSS to customize how your source files are handled with simple, 1-line build tool integrations.

Snowpack also ships with a built-in Parcel integration to help optimize your site for production. Bundling for productionÂ with Parcel keeps your site running fast without slowing down your development workflow.

### Supporting Old Browsers

**Snowpack builds sites for both modern and legacy browsers.** The only requirement is that you use a [modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module) *during development*. Any recent release of Firefox, Chrome, or Edge will do. 

When you build your site for production, Snowpack will automatically transpile your site to run on older browsers as well. You can control and customize this behavior with the ["browserlist" package.json property.](https://css-tricks.com/browserlist-good-idea/).


### Bundling for Production

**Snowpack gives you the best of both worlds: faster bundle-free development + optimized bundling in production.**

If you want to bundle your site for production, you can just use the optimized `--bundle` flag. This improves site performance while also allowing you to target even older, non-ESM browsers like IE11.You still have to pay the price for bundling (ie: longer builds) but only during production builds. Your development workflow stays bundle-free and fast.
