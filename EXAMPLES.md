## A Note on React

React is [not yet published with ES Module support](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11503). **However**, it is still possible to use with @pika/web thanks to @sdegutis's [@reactesm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/reactesm) project & npm/yarn's alias feature:

```
npm install react@npm:@reactesm/react react-dom@npm:@reactesm/react-dom
yarn add react@npm:@reactesm/react react-dom@npm:@reactesm/react-dom
```

This command installs ESM versions of the latest react & react-dom into your `node_modules/` directory, which @pika/web will then use when it installs your web_modules directory. This works with [any ESM-compatible React libraries](https://www.pika.dev/search?q=react-) as well!

```js
import React, { useState } from './web_modules/react.js';
```

## A Note on JSX

Remember that JSX is non-standard, and won't run in any browser. To use JSX with @pika/web:

1. Use Babel to build your `src/` directory to an output `lib/` directory, and load that in the browser.
1. Use a JSX-like library like Jason Miller's [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm).
