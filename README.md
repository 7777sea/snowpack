   <strong>Snowpack</strong> ‚Ä¢ Run npm packages directly in the browser. No Webpack, Parcel, or bundlers required.
</p>

- **Install any npm package to run directly in the browser via ESM.**
- Replaces traditional app bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, etc).
- Just run once at install time. No other tooling required.
- Enables tooling-free / build-free / bundle-free development.
- Works well with Import Maps.

``` bash
# try Snowpack before installing:
npx snowpack      
# or, install Snowpack locally: 
npm install --dev snowpack
```
